;; In this setting, we define the set of parameterized actions, such that we can perform 
;; a setup for SMErobotics by creating an instaintiation of a problem.
;;
;; 
;; In the advanced setting, we also assume that the human is working collaboratively. 
;; In this way, we can treat the action of the human to be the same as the robot action, 
;; and assign cost on that.
;; 
;; In the implementation, what is required is to perform a signaling to the human to work, 
;; and the robot waits until the task is accomplished. The mutual communication shall also 
;; be implemented.
